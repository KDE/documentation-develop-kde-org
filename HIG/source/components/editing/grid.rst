Guidelines
----------

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

On mouseover, items are darkened or highlighted 
(depending on the active color scheme) to 
emphasize their overlay buttons.

Overlay Buttons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overlay buttons only appear on mouseover. Overlay buttons should
only affect the item they are on. They should never affect other items.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~

-  All items must be the same size.
-  All rows, except the last one, have the same number of items
-  Overlay buttons are placed at the bottom right corner of items.
-  Grids have a PaperWhite background on desktop, and no background on
   mobile.
