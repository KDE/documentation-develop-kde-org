List View
=========

Purpose
-------

A list view offers orientation, organization, and allows navigation
without the need for more controls. Additionally, a list view may be
used for single selection (users select one item from a list of mutually
exclusive values) or multiple selections (selections in combination with
the Shift key or Control key). However, because there is no common
visual clue whether a list boxâ€™ mode is single or multiple and since
other controls are more efficient for single selection, a list box
should be used for single selection only.

Guidelines
----------

Is this the right control?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Prefer a list view to show items that belong together and in case
   there is enough space.
-  Use the list view for selection when it is easy for users to know
   which items are selected at any given time, for one or more of these
   reasons:

   -  There are no more than twice the number of options then are
      visible at a time
   -  The options are well-known and familiar (for example months of a
      year or days of a week)
   -  Usually the selected options are close to each other in the list

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

-  Don't have blank list items; use meta-options, e.g. (None) instead.
-  Place options that represent general options (e.g. All, None) at the
   beginning of the list.
-  Sort list items in a logical order. Make sure sorting fits
   translation.

   keyboard navigation with the list.

On-Demand Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

List items can uses an :doc:`on-demand pattern </patterns/command/ondemand>` as
an alternative to always-visible controls. If the user often performs tasks on 
single items of a list, you can add on-demand controls to the list item for 
these.

If only one action is available, most the time it is better to not use the 
on-demand pattern and instead show the action right away.

   loop="true" playsinline="true" width="320" controls="true" 
   onended="this.play()" class="border"></video>

On-demand controls are shown when hovering over the item with the cursor.
A handle is shown to support devices with touch screens. Swiping the handle 
right to left reveals the actions. 
As soon as the user taps anywhere else or the pointer is no longer 
hovering over the item, the handle is slid back.

On-demand controls are revealed by sliding a handle from right to left
to reveal them. As soon as the user taps anywhere else, the
handle is slid back.

Selection
^^^^^^^^^

List items can contain a checkbox to enable the selection of multiple items at 
the same time. Clicking on the checkbox should not trigger an action, but only 
change the selection. Place buttons below the list to perform actions on the 
selected items.

If the selection is the only action a user can execute on the items, there is 
no need for a checkbox. Change the background item color to toggle selection 
state.

-  Don't provide extended multiple selections with Shift+Click or
   Ctrl+Click to select groups of contiguous or non-adjacent values,
   respectively. Instead, use the 
   :doc:`dual-list pattern </patterns/content/duallist>` or the 
   :doc:`picker pattern </patterns/content/picker>` if multiple items
   have to be selected, because it allows users to easily see which
   items are selected at any point, without having to scroll through the
   available options, and it can be used with only the mouse.
   
Picker
^^^^^^

Lists can be used for the :doc:`picker pattern </patterns/content/picker>`. 
Place a button below the list to add items to the list. To remove items from 
the 
list, either add an remove action on the item, or give the user the possibility 
to select items and add a global remove button at the bottom of the list.

Ordering
^^^^^^^^

Allow drag and drop of items, if the the order of the items can be 
changed by the user.

If you use a :doc:`dual-list pattern </patterns/content/duallist>` and want 
to be able to re-order the items in the selected list you can add aditional up 
and 
down buttons.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Alternate row color (use theme settings). Use different keys (e.g.
   page up/down) when more lists should be accessible.
-  Show at least four list view items at any time without the need for
   scrolling.
-  Make windows and the list within a dialog or utility window
   resizeable so that users can choose how many list items are visible
   at a time without scrolling. Make these windows remember last used
   dimensions.
-  If selections affect the appearance or control states, place these
   controls next to the list view.
-  Disable controls in a dialog if not in use rather than hide, or
   remove them from the list (i.e. they are dependent controls),
-  Label the list view with a descriptive caption to the top left (cf.
   :doc:`alignment </layout/alignment>`).
-  Create a buddy relation so access keys are assigned.
-  End each label with a colon. ":"
-  Use :doc:`sentence style capitalization </style/writing/capitalization>`
   for list view items.

Selection
^^^^^^^^^

Checkboxes should be placed to the left of the item.

Add a :doc:`2 * Units.largeSpacing </layout/units>` margin between the checkbox 
and the icon or the label.

If you change the background color to toggle selection state, use 
Kirigami.Theme.highlightColor to indicate an active item.

Picker
^^^^^^

Place the button to add items to the bottom right of list.

For deselection you can either add a remove button for seleted icons next to 
the add button or use an icon on the list item.
