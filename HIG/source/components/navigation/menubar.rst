Menu bar
========

Purpose
-------

A *menu bar* appears at the top of an application's main window. It provides
access to all commands and most of the settings available in an application.

Users refer frequently to the menu bar, especially when they are seeking
a function for which they know of no other interface. Ensuring that menus are
well organized, are worded clearly, and behave correctly is crucial to the
userâ€™s ability to explore and access the functionality of the application.

Guidelines
----------

Is this the right control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A menu bar is mandatory for applications that have a
   :doc:`very complex command structure </patterns/command/index>`, such as
   those used for content creation or editing, file manipulation, or other
   productivity work.
-  Menu bars are optional for simple apps that are able to expose all
   functionality using visible buttons and toolbars. If any functionality is
   not visible by default, err on the side of providing a menu bar.
-  Do not display a menu bar in secondary or internal windows, like the
   settings dialog or file dialog. Very small main windows are likewise usually
   poor candidates for menu bars.
-  Do not include a menu bar in a convergent application's mobile user
   interface.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

-  Do not have more than nine menu categories within a menu bar. Too
   many categories are overwhelming and makes the menu bar difficult to
   use.
-  At the minimum, all windows should have File, Edit, Settings, and Help menus.
   If they apply, the window can also have View, Insert, Format, Tools and,
   Window menus.
-  Do not put more than 12 items within a single level of a menu. Add
   separators between logical groups within a menu. Organize the menu
   items into groups of seven or fewer strongly related items.
-  Assign shortcut keys to the most frequently used menu
   items. Use `KStandardAction <https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kconfigwidgets/html/namespaceKStandardAction.html>`_
   and `KStandardShortcut <https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kconfig/html/namespaceKStandardShortcut.html>`_ items for common functions, which will
   result in menu items automatically receiving consistent names, icons, and
   shortcut keys. Any tool or function that is accessible using a keyboard
   shortcut must have an item in the menu bar so that users can discover it.
-  Do not hide the menu bar by default. If this is configurable, users should
   easily be able to make the menu bar viewable again.
-  Use submenus cautiously. Submenus add complexity to the interface and
   are physically more difficult to use, so you should take care not to
   overuse them.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~
-  Place the most frequently used items at the top of the menu.
-  Provide icons for all menu items. Do not re-use the same icon for multiple
   items.
-  For your menu items' text, follow the
   :doc:`general label guidelines </style/writing/labels>`.
-  Do not change menu items' labels dynamically.
-  Choose single word names for menu categories. Using multiple words
   makes the separation between categories confusing.
-  Disable menu items that don't apply to the current context instead
   of removing them from view. **Exception:** It is acceptable to hide menu
   items completely if they are permanently unavailable on the user's system
   due to missing hardware capabilities.
-  Assign :doc:`shortcut keys <shortcuts>` to the most frequently used menu items
   (Ctrl+). For well-known shortcut keys, use standard assignments. Use
   function keys for commands that have a small-scale effect (F2 =
   Rename) and ctrl key for large-scale effect (Ctrl+S = Save).
-  For menu items that toggle some state on or off, always use the positive
   form. For example, use the text 'Show hidden files' instead of 'Hide hidden
   files', and do not change the text when hidden files are shown.
