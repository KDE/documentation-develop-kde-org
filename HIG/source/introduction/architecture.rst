Architecture
============

There are three different UI toolkits you can use to development for `KDE 
Application <https://www.kde.org/applications/>`_ or the `Plasma Workspace 
<https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop.php>`_ (Due to technical limitations, the 
toolkits have slight visual differences, but the recommended interaction 
patterns to be used are consistent regardless of the toolkit).

KDE Applications
----------------
There are two UI toolkits that can be used to develop KDE Applications:

* `Kirigami <https://www.kde.org/products/kirigami/>`_
* `Qt Widgets <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-index.html>`_

Kirigami is KDEâ€™s lightweight user interface framework for mobile and 
convergent applications. It allows Qt developers to easily create applications 
that run on most major mobile and desktop platforms without modification (though 
adapted user interfaces for different form-factors are supported and recommended 
for optimal user experience). It extends the touch-friendly Qt Quick Controls 
with larger application building blocks.

Use Qt Widgets only if you plan to develop a desktop-only application with a complex UI, like KDevelop.

.. hint::
   |devicon| To test qml scenes use
   
   * ``QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_MOBILE=1`` and ``QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Plasma``
     for mobile
   * ``QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_MOBILE=0`` and 
     ``QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=org.kde.desktop`` for desktop

Plasma Workspace
----------------
Plasma is built on widgets, allowing you to move, mix, add, and remove just 
about everything to perfect your personal workflow. Use `plasma components v3 
<https://api.kde.org/frameworks/plasma-framework/html/plasmacomponents.html>`_ 
to develop widgets for the :doc:`Plasma Mobile <pm:Introduction>` and Plasma 
Desktop workspace.

Common Components
-----------------

The KDE HIG defines a set of common components which are independent of any 
:doc:`device type <devicetypes>`.

- **Workspace**: The top-level container of the whole user interface. Often
  called "desktop", "home screen", or "shell", it shows the wallpaper and
  allows users to add widgets, app launchers, files or folders.

- **Application Launcher**: Provides an overview of installed applications and
  allows the user to launch one of them.

- **Application Shortcuts**: Provides quick access to frequently-used
  applications.

- **Active Application Overview**: Provides an overview of the active
  applications that are directly used by the user.

- **Workspace Tools**: Provides quick access to functionality integrated
  into the workspace that is both highly visible to the user and frequently
  changed, like enabling/disabling WiFi and Bluetooth, or whether or not to
  show notifications.

- **Application-Workspace Interaction**: Displays information about each
  application's windows, and provides ways to move or close them and change how
  they run within the workspace.

- **Application**: The top-level container of a single application.

- **Application Tools**: Provides access to an application's commonly-used
  functionality in an always-accessible toolbar or menubar. These tools should
  not change depending on what the application is displaying.

- **Application Content**: The actual content of an application. This depends
  on the application itself, but conformance to the KDE HIG should make it
  easier to allow :doc:`convergence <convergence>` for this  component. This 
  part of the application can also contain contextually-appropriate tools 
  that operate directly on the active or selected content.

Theme
-----
There are three different kinds of themes influencing the the look-and-feel of KDE applications and the Plasma workspace.

* Workspace
* Application
* Window decoration

The default for all there of them is *Breeze*.

.. note::
   Only *Breeze*, *Breeze dark*, *Breeze Light*, *Breeze Highcontrast*  are covered by the HIG, all other themes are not covered.
