Personas
========

   Personas are a simple way of grounding your design toward the type of people you consider your software's target user. In your design sessions, you can call out the names of these personas to help you and your team make changes to your software. That way, you can ensure that your design is consistent with KDE visual goals.
   
   Software that you write will not necessarily satisfy all personas. It should not be the case either that you look to meet every persona's expectations through your software. Instead, focus your efforts into the persona that best meets your target audience and work to strengthen your software toward that KDE-specific audience.
   
KDE Personas: Background
------------------------

The question "Why should people switch to KDE?" was an important factor
in the creation of our Personas – a crucial aspect if we want to extend
the current user base. The "Technology Adoption Lifecycle" by Rogers
(1962) deals with this question by splitting the overall user base in
groups along a bell curve according to their willingness to adopt new
technology.

Looking at the "Technology Adoption Lifecycle", you'll find the
following user groups:

We suggest to move away from the *KDE is for everybody* approach to *KDE
is for the more sophisticated 50% of computer users out there, who
choose it because it perfectly suits their work and that they "want to
have it".*

Concentrating on this user base rather than everybody has both pragmatic
and motivational reasons: Pragmatically, it will be hard to make KDE a
favourite product for *laggards* and even the *late majority* within the
next five years. Neither cutting away functionality nor hiding all the
complexity behind *Advanced* buttons is an acceptable solution. Second,
creating a desktop for ambitious users better fits the current
motivation in the KDE development base. We don't want to be *simple and
limited*, we want to develop a smart desktop with rich functionality!

To avoid misunderstandings: KDE will still be an option for educational,
governmental or large enterprise usage – but it won't be the main focus
when developing the default desktop. KDE as a configurable set of tools can
still be adjusted to meet the needs of any other user base.

Berna works as an office clerk in a big insurance company. Although she is a very smart
person, she is very often unsure how technology can help her.

Berna's biggest daily task is to check on the details of insurance claims. She writes
reports for her boss suggesting compensation payouts for the cases she
deals with. Berna is a very detail oriented individual, and always resolves her tasks accurately.

Berna lost several hours of work twice because she didn't understand the
options she was offered with technology. Since then, she has been very careful when testing new functionality in the software she uses. She prefers to keep things simple.

Matt

Matt is a geology student in the last year of his undergraduate studies.
For him, technology is meant to simplify annoying and repetitive tasks.

For his student research projects, Matt has to do extensive research on
the web, and has to manage a database of pictures of stones and other geologic materials. He gains credits by using his notes to create reports and presentations.

Matt often struggles to keep track of all his notes. He is looking for
an effective routine, so he can concentrate on the content rather than
on finding information.

Susan

While Susan seldom uses her computer for work, it has become an
essential part of her social life. With her computer, she can be
creative and spread this creativity to the world.

She chats with her friends, shares music, playlists and other media,
creates videos and uploads them to her web space, and runs a blog with
her own style. She can't imagine a life without her laptop.

She is a fun person and does not want to worry about technical
details. She expects her machine to work.

Santiago

Santiago runs a medium-sized electric installations business. For
him, technology needs to be comfortable and make him feel smart.

As a manager with an engineering background, Santiago's main task is customer negotiations. However, to avoid costs, he is the administrator for the small network at the company, including a file server and
fifteen PCs for his office clerks.

He loves comfort, does not like to dive into manuals or use the
command line to set up the small network. Santiago relies on the UI to achieve these results. The system has to be reliable and easy to use, so his employees get along with it.

Philip

Philip is a high-school student in his last year. He wants to go
to college to study computer science. He loves the challenge of
making technology do what he wants it to do.

When he was 14, he tried different programming languages, and
since then has implemented various applications he published
under free licenses. He is convinced that Linux is the way to go and understands the benefits of free software.

Philip is fancy about technology and is never discouraged if something
does not work as expected. He feels that as a power user he can fix technical issues himself.
