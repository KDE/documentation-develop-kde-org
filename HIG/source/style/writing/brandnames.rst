Brand Names
===========

Purpose
-------

Brand names are catchy, easy-to-remember names that provide identity and an
emotional connection to KDE's software. They are read and written publicly and
serve as part of a project's public face.

What needs a brand name?
------------------------

-  Each app's name is automatically a brand name.
-  Major non-app projects should have their own brand names. For example,
   *Plasma*, *KWin*, *Baloo,* and *Kirigami.*
-  Individual features within apps are not brand names and should be
   :doc:`labeled descriptively <labels>`.


Creating a good brand name
--------------------------
-  Brand names should be catchy, easy to remember, and fun-sounding. Avoid
   negative language.
-  Use only a single word, preferably one related to the app's purpose--even
   just tangentially.
-  Don't simply add a "K" onto the beginning of an existing word. It's
   acceptable to choose a brand name with a K inside it, or even replace a "C"
   with a "K" (e.g. *Falkon*, *DigiKam*), but don't force it. Not all KDE brand
   names need to have a K (e.g. *Dolphin*, or *Plasma*).
-  Don't use common words like "Files" or "Videos." If your brand name is too
   generic, its identity will be diluted and users will have a hard time finding
   it in web searches.
-  Each brand name needs an :doc:`icon or logo </style/icons/index>`. The logo
   should reinforce the name. For more abstractly-named brands, the logo should
   provide visual information regarding the software's purpose that is not
   contained within the name (e.g. Dolphin's logo looks like a folder, providing
   a clue that it's a file manager).
