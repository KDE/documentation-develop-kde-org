Imagery
=======

Purpose
-------

Images can convey meaning and emotion. Preserving these characteristics
is the primary focus of this guideline.

Guidelines
----------

-  Ensure images have the appropriate resolution for their containers.
   Don't scale images beyond their native resolution; they will end up
   fuzzy or pixelated.
-  Don't be afraid of larger image sizes. Images are most effective when
   they can be seen. Tiny images lose much of their meaning (unless they
   are specifically crafted for small sizes).
-  For example, consider a large contact photo (left) instead of a tiny
   thumbnail image (right). People recognize faces faster than names,
   therefore, making an image bigger, will connect with the user faster
   and make it more recognizable.

-  Captions can be placed on the image (left) instead of outside of the
   image (right) allowing the image to be larger and the content to be
   more immersive showing belonging.

-  Use a :doc:`scrim </components/navigation/scrim>` behind the caption text to preserve
   contrast for legibility.
-  Try to preserve the image aspect ratio. If preserving the aspect
   ratio is a challenge, consider cropping the image to fill the
   container instead.
