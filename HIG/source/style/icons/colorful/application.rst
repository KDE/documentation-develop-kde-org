Purpose
-------

Application icons are the expression of an application's brand. They
communicate the application's identity in a clear, bold, and friendly manner.
While application icons should be distinct from one another, all icons should be
unified with the same design style.

Design
------
Application icons always use the `colorful icon style <colorful.html>`_. Their baseline size is 48 pixels.

1st-Party App Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When creating a Breeze icon as your application's icon, there are some things
you should consider.

Recognizability
+++++++++++++++

Your application's icon should be distinct and recognisable.

.. container:: flex

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/distinct-do.png
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Use a distinct silhouette and set of
         colors. You can sample motifs from
         other icons where appropriate to help
         with recognizability.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/distinct-dont.png
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't solely base your application's icon
         off of another icon. This can confuse
         users, and tarnish both the reputation
         of your app and the app whose icon you use.

Metaphor
+++++++++++++++

Your app's icon should use an appropriate metaphor to inform the user
what your app does.

.. container:: flex

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/metaphor-do.png
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Use an appropriate metaphor for your icon;
         this will inform users as to what your app does.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/metaphor-dont.png
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use inappropriate metaphors for your icon;
         this will confuse users as to what your app does.

3rd-Party App Icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When creating a Breeze theme version of an existing app's icon, it critically
important that the icon's existing brand and visual style be preserved. The
goal is to create a Breeze version of the icon, not something completely new
and different.

.. container:: flex

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/gimp-do.png
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Retain the silhouette of an app's icon
         to preserve its core branding and
         recognizability for users.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/gimp-dont-silhouette.png
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't dramatically change the shape
         of an app's icon; this will make the
         application hard to recognize.

.. container:: flex

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/telegram-do.png
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Retain the general branding colors
         of an app's icon to preserve branding
         recognizability.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/telegram-dont.png
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use a radically different
         color palette from an app's icon;
         this will make it hard to recognize,
         especially at small sizes.
