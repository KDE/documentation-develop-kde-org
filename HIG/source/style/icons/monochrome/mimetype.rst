MIME Type Icons
===============

MIME type icons are used to depict documents and files. They come in four sizes:
16px, 22px, 32px, and 64px. MIME type icons use the `monochrome style \
<../monochrome/index.html>`__ for 16px and 22px sizes, and the
`colorful style <index.html>`__ for 32px and 64px sizes.

Unlike most monochromatic icons, MIME type icons use the primary color of their 
colourful counterpart.

Purpose
-------

MIME type icons allow a user to quickly recognize the types of their files
without needing to look at a file's extension or contents. They primarily 
appear in file listings in large amounts, and their design reflects a sense of
unity among files in a user's system.

Iconography
~~~~~~~~~~~

MIME type icons use bold and recognizable symbols that allow a user
to determine the filetype at a glance.

      .. figure:: /img/mono-mime-do.png
         :scale: 80%
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Use a bold and recognizable icon.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/mono-mime-dont.png
         :scale: 80%
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use an overly generic iconâ€”
         this makes it hard for users to determine
         filetype.

MIME types associated with a brand identity use elements of their
brand to make it easier for users to connect the icon to its filetype.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/mono-mimebrand-rss.png

         The usage of the RSS icon allows users to
         recognize the RSS feed MIME type.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/mono-mimebrand-deb.png

         The usage of the Debian logo allows users to
         recognize the deb package MIME type.
