Purpose
-------

Icons are pictorial representations of functions and objects. They convey
meaning that users perceive almost instantaneously and are an important part of
a program's visual identity.

Well-designed icons strongly impact users' overall impression of the design.
Consistent use of icons also improves usability by making programs, objects,
and actions easier to identify and learn.

.. note:: 
   
   See the `workflow tips on how to create an icon \
   <https://community.kde.org/Guidelines_and_HOWTOs/Icon_Workflow_Tips>`_ if 
   you are interested in designing icons for your application. Or you can
   ask the `KDE Visual Design Group \
   <https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/design#Communication_and_workflow>`_ 
   for help.




General Guidelines
------------------

-  Use icons from the system icon theme whenever possible. Avoid using custom
   icons. New icons should be added to an icon theme.
-  Design icons with a small number of metaphors that are understandable
   independent of language and culture. Apply metaphors only once (e.g. don't
   use a brush twice for different actions).
-  Simplify, but don't go overboard.
-  Avoid using text in icon designs; it cannot be localized and tends to look
   bad at small sizes.
-  Many icons come in multiple sizes. Each version should be visually optimized
   and pixel-perfect for its particular size. Larger sizes offer more
   opportunity for detail and visual pizazz, while smaller version should be
   stripped of everything not absolutely necessary.




Monochrome icon style
---------------------

   :alt: Monochrome icons

Monochrome icons come in two sizes: 16px and 22px. 16px monochrome icons are
commonly seen in menu items, tabs, and push buttons that have a raised,
buttonlike appearance. 22px monochrome icons are used in ToolButtons. Monochrome
icons at both sizes are used to represent small file types and entries in the
Places panel in Dolphin and file dialogs.

Don't use the monochrome style for larger icon sizes.

The Monochrome style is used for `Action, Status, <action_status.html>`_ 
small `Places, <places.html>`_ and small `MIME type <mimetype.html>`_ icons.


Colors
~~~~~~
The monochrome style relies on distinct shapes and outlines instead of fine
details and vibrant colors, and employs an intentionally limited color palette:

   #. |shadeblack| :doc:`Shade Black <../color/index>` (``#232629``): Used for
      icons in a normal state and non-destructive actions: back, forward, ok,
      home, etc.This is the most commonly used color. When in doubt, choose
      Shade Black.
   #. |iconred| :doc:`Icon Red<../color/index>` (``#da4453``): Used for icons
      that depict negative or destructive actions: "delete," "remove," "stop,"
      etc.
   #. |bewareorange| :doc:`Beware Orange <../color/index>` (``#f67400``): Used
      for icons that involve warnings and user input of some kind.
   #. |plasmablue| :doc:`Plasma Blue <../color/index>` (``#3daee9``): Used for
      icons that involve the action "select" or "insert".
   #. |noblefir| :doc:`Noble Fir <../color/index>` (``#27ae60``): Used for icons
      that involve positive or successful actions: "connected", "secure", etc.

Margins and alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
16px monochrome icons should not use the top or bottom 2 pixels, and 22px
monochrome icons should not use the top or bottom 3 pixels:

It is recommended to keep monochrome icons perfectly square. For some types of 
icons described later (e.g. Places icons) this is a hard requirement.

Because monochrome icons are so small and simple, it is important that they be
pixel-perfect, with their lines and objects aligned to a regular grid:

Adding Emblems to monochrome icons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because monochrome icons usually depict actions, many include status or action
emblems. These are always located in the bottom-right corner. The emblem should
be a minimum of 5px wide and tall, and there must be 1px of blank space between
the emblem and the rest of the icon.

Colorful icon style
-------------------
.. image:: /img/Sample_color_icons.png
   :alt: Colorful icons

Colorful Breeze icons make full use the
:doc:`Breeze color palette <../color/index>`. They are **not** "flat" and
incorporate shadows and smooth linear gradients going from darker on the bottom
to lighter on top. Don't be afraid to add detail, vibrancy, and depth!

This style of icon comes in three sizes:

-  32px: `Category, Preferences, <category_preferences.html>`_ `MIME type, \
   <mimetype.html>`_ and `Places <places.html>`_ icons
-  48px: `Application <application.html>`_ icons
-  64px: `MIME type, <mimetype.html>`_ `Places, <places.html>`_ Devices, and a
   few `Status <action_status.html>`_ icons

At all sizes, colorful Breeze icons generally consist of three parts:

First part: background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The background is a container and gives structure to the icon. It can have any
shape or color in the Breeze color palette. Don't be afraid to get creative with the background shape!

Second part: foreground symbol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The foreground symbol offers contrast with its background and works with it to
provide the bulk of the icon's meaning. The foreground symbol is optional; feel
free to omit it if the background provides enough meaning on its own.

Third part: shadows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If present, the foreground symbol casts a long shadow angled 45Â°
towards the bottom-right corner. This shadow always has the same gradient and
takes up the whole object.

In addition, colorful icons have a 1 px hard shadow on the bottom:
