   :alt: Toolbar + Menu Button

   Toolbar with the most common actions and a menu button for additional 
   actions

-  Use Toolbar + Menu Button command pattern when the number of
   frequently used commands are about 8 or less, and the remaining
   commands are not essential to performing the primary task of the
   application. The toolbar pattern exposes the frequently used
   commands. The menu button pattern exposes more of the command
   structure.
-  Commands are also exposed using context menus, a context panel or by
   the direct manipulation of content.
   
See :doc:`toolbar </components/navigation/toolbar>` for 
more details.

On mobile, a toolbar is diplayed as a group of
:doc:`primary action buttons </components/navigation/actionbutton>`.

-  If there are controls that need to be accessed often within the
   application's primary tasks but the content needs as much space to be
   available as possible, you can add up to three primary action buttons
-  The primary action buttons are at the bottom of the user interface and 
    there cannot be more then three buttons.
-  If more than three actions are required, put the remaining ones in the
   :doc:`global drawer </components/navigation/globaldrawer>` 
   or :doc:`context drawer </components/navigation/contextdrawer>`.
