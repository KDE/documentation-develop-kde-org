Help system
===========

The *help system* should be used as a secondary mechanism to support
users’ complete and better understanding of tasks — the primary
mechanism should be the user interface itself. Users consult the help
system only if they can't accomplish a task with the UI.

When to use
-----------
Try to make Help unnecessary in the first place:

-  Make common tasks easy to discover and perform.
-  Provide clear main instructions as well as concise control labels
   that are goal- and task-oriented.
-  Provide supplemental instructions and explanations where needed.
-  Avoid problems by using controls constrained to valid choices,
   providing suitable default values, handling all input formats, and
   preventing errors.
-  Write error messages that provide a clear solution or action for the
   user to take.

How to use
----------

-  Usually, the help system is activated by F1 respectively Ctrl+F1 for
   context sensitive information and via menu.
