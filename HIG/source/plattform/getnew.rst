Guidelines
----------

Is this the right control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a GNS button to an application or a KCM, if the user can install aditional 
content from the integrated data service. You might want to accompany it by a 
button that allows the user to install content from the local file system.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~

The text of a GNS button should be made of these parts:

-  Use the get-hot-new-stuff.png icon
   
   .. image:: /img/get-hot-new-stuff.svg
      :width: 32
      :height: 32

-  Label the button with "Get New" and the type of content the user will 
   download
-  Add an :doc:`ellipsis to the label </style/writing/labels>`, to indicate the 
   user must provide additional input to complete the task.

The button should always be placed on the bottom right of the list or grid that 
can be ammended. If you want a button to install from the local file system, 
place it to the left og the GNS button.
