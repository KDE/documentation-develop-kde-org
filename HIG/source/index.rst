The KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer designers and developers a set of recommendations for producing beautiful, usable, and consistent user interfaces
for convergent desktop and mobile applications and workspace widgets. Their aim
is to improve the experience for users by making application and widget
interfaces more consistent and hence more intuitive and learnable.

   ''Simple by default, powerful when needed.''


Design Vision
-------------
KDE's design vision focuses on two attributes of KDE software that connect its
future to its history:

**Simple by default...**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Simple and inviting. KDE software is pleasant to experience and easy to use.*

-  **Make it easy to focus on what matters** — Remove or minimize elements
   not crucial to the primary or main task. Use spacing to keep things
   organized. Use color to draw attention. Reveal additional information or
   optional functions only when needed.
-  **I know how to do that!** — Make things easier to learn by reusing design
   patterns from other applications. Other applications that use good design
   are a precedent to follow.
-  **Do the heavy lifting for me** — Make complex tasks simple. Make novices
   feel like experts. Create ways in which your users can naturally feel
   empowered by your software.

**...Powerful when needed**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Power and flexibility. KDE software allows users to be effortlessly creative
and efficiently productive.*

-  **Solve a problem** — Identify and make very clear to the user what need is
   addressed and how.
-  **Always in control** — It should always be clear what can be done, what is
   currently happening, and what has just happened. The user should never
   feel at the mercy of the tool. Give the user the final say.
-  **Be flexible** — Provide sensible defaults but consider optional
   functionality and customization options that don't interfere with the
   primary task.

.. note::
    Note: KDE encourages developing and designing for customization, while
    providing good default settings. Integrating into other desktop environments
    is also a virtue, but ultimately we aim for perfection within our own Plasma
    desktop environment with the default themes and settings. This aim should
    not be compromised.
