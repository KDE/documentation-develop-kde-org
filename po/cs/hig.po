"Welcome to the KDE Human Interface Guidelines! Following them will help you "
"build a beautiful and powerful app that feels at home when run in [KDE "
"Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop), and works well outside of it. Users "
"will learn how to use your app quickly, accomplish their goals with ease, "
"and encounter fewer issues requiring support."

"Design determines how well something fulfills its functional purpose and how "
"enjoyable it is to interact with. If either is lacking, the result will be "
"frustrating. People won't want to use a poorly-designed app, and if forced "
"to, they'll be resentful and spread negativity about it. Avoid this through "
"good design!"

#: content/hig/_index.md:28
msgid ""
"Design involves targeted decisions and trade-offs that bring a project "
"closer to its intended goals and usage paradigms. The best apps know which "
"users and use cases they're targeting, and which ones they leave for others. "
"It's better to succeed by focusing on what you can do well than to spread "
"yourself thin and fail. Under-promise and over-deliver, never the reverse."
