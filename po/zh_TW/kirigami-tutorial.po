"This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating your own "
"convergent application using the [Kirigami framework](/frameworks/kirigami). "
"A *convergent application*, in this context, means people can use the "
"program easily regardless of the device it is running on. If it is on a "
"desktop computer, it will adapt to a large screen and a mouse and keyboard; "
"if it is being used on a mobile device, it will accept input from a "
"touchscreen and adapt to a smaller portrait screen. And so on."

"Kirigami is built on top of the QML language and Qt Quick Controls 2 "
"components provided by the Qt project. QML has built in support for touch "
"systems, which makes it ideal for mobile apps. Qt Quick components are "
"reusable visual items we can use when building our applications' interfaces. "
"Kirigami is a set of Qt Quick components designed for creating convergent "
"applications."

"While you will use QML to create the visual part of your application, the "
"business logic—the code that does the heavy lifting for your application's "
"functionality—is usually created in C++ for performance reasons. We will "
"also explore how to integrate our business logic with our UI in the "
"tutorials below."
