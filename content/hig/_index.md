The KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer designers and developers
a set of recommendations for producing beautiful, usable, and consistent
user interfaces for convergent desktop and mobile applications and
workspace widgets. Their aim is to improve the experience for users by
making application and widget interfaces more consistent, intuitive, and learnable.

## Design Vision

**"Simple by default, powerful when needed"** encapsulates KDE software's design principles. We encourage KDE software enthusiasts to follow this model. Using this idea while creating applications will deliver a compliant experience for all our users.

Let's review this two-part motto more closely:

### "Simple by default..."

KDE software removes elements not crucial to complete a primary or main task. Use good spacing to keep things organized and show hierarchy. Use color to draw attention but not as the primary way to communicate information to the user. Keep the default information small and targeted.

Our software is easy to learn by reusing design patterns and action patterns used in everyday devices. KDE software follows [Jakob's Law](https://lawsofux.com/jakobs-law.html).

KDE applications make complex tasks simple. It makes novices feel like experts and creates ways for users to feel naturally empowered.

### "...Powerful when needed"

KDE software should help users resolve difficult problems. Users receive software tools to identify what is needed and address a given situation.

KDE software also provides integration with other desktop environments. However, our team ultimately aims for perfection within our own Plasma Desktop environment. Our default themes and settings have priority over integration with other environments.

KDE software provides users a clear understanding of the system's capabilities, what is currently happening, and what has just happened. KDE users should never feel at the mercy of the application. KDE software users should have the final say.

As you design and develop for KDE, applications should provide sensible defaults and powerful customization. These default settings should not interfere with the application's primary task.
