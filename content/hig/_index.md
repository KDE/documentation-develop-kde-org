The KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer designers and developers a set of recommendations for producing beautiful, usable, and consistent user interfaces for convergent desktop and mobile applications and workspace widgets. Their aim is to improve the experience for users by making application and widget interfaces more consistent, intuitive, and learnable.

## Design Vision

KDE adopted a motto to encapsulate the main ideas around its design: **"Simple by default, powerful when needed"**.

### "Simple by default..."

KDE software removes elements not crucial to complete a primary or main task. Use good spacing to keep things organized and show hierarchy. Use color to draw attention but not as the primary way to communicate information to the user. Keep the default information small and targeted.

KDE makes things easier to learn by reusing design patterns from other applications and recognizable action patterns used in everyday devices.

KDE makes complex tasks simple and makes novices feel like experts. Create ways in which users feel naturally empowered by KDE software.

### "...Powerful when needed"

KDE software should help users resolve difficult problems. It should give them a clear understanding of what can be done, what is currently happening, and what has just happened. Users users should never feel at the mercy of the application.

Provide sensible defaults, but consider optional functionality and customization options that don't interfere with the software's primary functionality.

KDE software is appropriate for a wide spectrum of usage scenarios by implementing optional functionality and cusomization. However, the default settings with their intended workflow should not be compromised.
