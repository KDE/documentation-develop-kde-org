title: Icons and Text
---
==============

When to Use
-----------

Combining icons and text can be used to identify data and actions in a
user interface. Examples include toolbar actions, file and folder
displays in a file manager, application listings, and notifications. The
layout should be consistent.

How to Use
----------

-   Where icons are shown with text, use the layout guidelines above.

Implementation
--------------

-   For 16x16px icons and smaller, the 8px margins may be reduced to
    4px.
-   Where icons are shown without text, always provide tooltip text and
    alternate text for accessibility.
-   If Secondary Text is normally present, but is empty in a particular
    instance, align the Primary Text to the vertical center.
