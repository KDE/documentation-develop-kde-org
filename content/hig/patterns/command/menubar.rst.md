Menubar

![Menubar](/img/CP-MenuBar.png)

-   Use the Menubar pattern when access to the full command structure is
    necessary to complete the primary tasks of the application.
-   Commands are also exposed using toolbars, context menus, a context
    panel or by direct manipulation of content.
-   Commands in the menubar should generally be globally applicable.
    Consider using a context panel or a context menu for commands that
    are specific to the current selection.
