title: Patterns for a Simple Command Structure
---
=======================================

![Simple command structure](/hig/CP-Simple.png)

-   Use Menu Button command pattern when there are few globally
    applicable commands. The menu button can overlay content.
-   Use Context Menu or Context Panel command patterns for commands
    specific to selected or currently visible content.
-   The menu button pattern can be combined with either of the context
    menu or context panel patterns.
-   Commands can also be exposed by direct manipulation of content
    (click, drag, buttons, search field, pan, zoom, etc).
-   For plasmoids, all commands must be exposed by direct manipulation
    of content - no menu button, context menu, or context panel.
