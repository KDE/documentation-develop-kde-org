title: One-Handed Use

==============

Purpose
-------

According to
[research](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php),
about half of users use their phone with just one hand in any given
situation. This behavior limits the areas they can comfortably reach
with their thumb. The safest way to hold a phone in one hand is resting
the bottom end in the palm. Another 15% of people hold them in the palms
with both hands. Both ways to hold a phone make the top of the screen
harder to reach.

As shown in the examples above, the green areas of the phone are the
most reachable.

Accordingly, Kirigami\'s phone components are optimized to favor the
center or bottom of the screen for primary interactive elements, while
placing secondary elements into drawers which can be opened from up to
three different points of the screen.

Kirigami also features the \"overscroll\" feature, which allows you pull
down the top part of the screen in case you have to reach e.g. the
topmost items of a list.

When using Kirigami on a phone, make sure that often-used controls are
never placed at the top of the screen, and also avoid the screen corners
in general.
