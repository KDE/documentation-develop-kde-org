title: Context Menu
---
============

Purpose
-------

A *context menu* displays a list of actions applicable to the current
context. It is normally hidden from view (except
`menu bars <menubar>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}) and drops down when
the user right-clicks on something.

Context menus should be considered accelerators for advanced desktop
users. Many mouse users don\'t think to right-click on things. The
right-click gesture required to show a context menus can be difficult to
perform on many laptops, and it is flat-out impossible on a touch
device.

Guidelines
----------

### Is this the right control?

-   Provide a context menu for any item with actions that can be
    performed on it.
-   Provide a context menu for common actions like \'Copy\' and
    \'Paste\' for textual controls, or navigation actions like
    \'Forward\' and \'Backward.
-   Don\'t use context menus as the only way to access functionality.
    Every item in a context menu must be available via a method that is
    somehow visible by default\--typically the app\'s main
    `menu bar <menubar>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}, but also via
    toolbar buttons.

### Behavior and Appearance

See the guidelines for `menu bars <menubar>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
