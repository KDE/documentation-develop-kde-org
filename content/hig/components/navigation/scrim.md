A scrim is a temporary effect applied to a surface for the purpose of
making content below it less prominent.

Examples
--------

![A scrim being used to indicate that a drawer is
modal.](/hig/drawer-scrim.png)

![A scrim being overlaid on an image to allow a readable caption on top
of it.](/hig/ImageCaption1.png)

Is this the right control?
--------------------------

Most controls that require scrims will apply one themselves, such as
drawers.

Manually apply scrims only when:

-   Content would not be legible without them.
-   Modal controls are overlaid on content.
