        Editing and Manipulation considers the behaviors that result in persistent
        changes to userâ€™s stored information. Behaviors in this layer can often be
        recognized by the following traits: they result in persistent, stored changes;
        they require an implicit or explicit save operation; and they typically require
        validation of the input data.
