Device Types
============

In today's world, there are many types of digital devices: desktop and laptop
computers, smartphones, tablets, and so on. A harmonious and efficient user
experience is only possible when the software's user interface is tailored to
each device's physical characteristics and the way that a user will interact
with it.

For information regarding the differences between a user interface and the user 
experience, see the :doc:`responsive in the HIG <hig:resources/glossary>`.

Some devices are adaptable, e.g. a tablet with a keyboard plugged in, or a
convertible laptop with only the touchscreen in use. These types of devices
will require the user interface to adapt as necessary for each usage mode.
If minimal changes are needed (for example, a laptop plugged into a large
external screen) this can be achieved with a "responsive" design, as described
in :doc:`responsive in the HIG <hig:introduction/responsive>`. For more 
extensive changes (for example, a tablet plugged into a docking station with a 
mouse and keyboard attached), an entirely different user interface paradigm may 
need to be presented.
