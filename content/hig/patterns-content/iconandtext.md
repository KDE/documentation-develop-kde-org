When to Use
-----------

Combining icons and text can be used to identify data and actions in a
user interface. Examples include toolbar actions, file and folder
displays in a file manager, application listings, and notifications. The
layout should be consistent.

How to Use
----------

![Alignment of text and icons.](/hig/HIGPatternIconsAndText.png)

{{< alert color="warning" title="Attention" >}}
Make sure to read about how [units and measurements](/layout/units)
are used for design and development.
{{< /alert >}}

-   Where icons are shown with text, use the layout guidelines above.

Implementation
--------------

-   For 16x16px icons and smaller, the 8px margins may be reduced to
    4px.
-   Where icons are shown without text, always provide tooltip text and
    alternate text for accessibility.
-   If Secondary Text is normally present, but is empty in a particular
    instance, align the Primary Text to the vertical center.
