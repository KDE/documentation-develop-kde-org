Get New Stuff (GNS) is an integrated data service which allows users to
share and download themes, templates, wallpapers, and more through a
single click of a button in the application.

Guidelines
----------

### Is this the right control?

If the user can install additional content to customize the behavior or
appearance of the software (e.g. plugins, themes, scripts, etc.), use
the GNS system and add a "Get New <Thing>" button. Consider adding a
companion button to allow installation of additional content from the
filesystem.

### Appearance

The text of a GNS button should be made of these parts:

-   Use the get-hot-new-stuff.png icon

    ![image](/hig/get-hot-new-stuff.svg)

-   Label the button with "Get New" and the type of content the user
    will download

-   Add an
    [ellipsis to the label](/style/writing/labels), to indicate the
    user must provide additional input to complete the task.

The button should always be placed on the bottom right of the list or
grid that can be ammended. If you want a button to install from the
local file system, place it to the left og the GNS button.
