Scrim
=====

A scrim is a temporary effect applied to a surface for the purpose
of making content below it less prominent.

Examples
--------

.. figure:: /img/drawer-scrim.png
   :alt: A scrim being used to indicate that a drawer is modal.

.. figure:: /img/ImageCaption1.png
   :alt: A scrim being overlaid on an image to allow a readable caption on top of it.

Is this the right control?
--------------------------

Most controls that require scrims will apply one themselves, such as drawers.

Manually apply scrims only when:

-  Content would not be legible without them.
-  Modal controls are overlaid on content.
