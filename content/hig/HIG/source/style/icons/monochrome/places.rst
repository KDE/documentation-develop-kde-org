Places Icons
============

Places icons are used to depict folders, network locations, and other places.
They come in four sizes: 16px, 22px, 32px, and 64px. Places icons use the
`monochrome style <index.html>`__ for 16px and 22px sizes,
and the `colorful style <../colorful/index.html>`__ for 32px and 64px 
sizes.

Purpose
-------

Places icons allow a user to quickly identify landmarks in their filesystems.
They indicate places that a user will visit frequently,
such as home, root, downloads, etc.

Design

Iconography
~~~~~~~~~~~

Places icons use bold and recognizable symbols that allow a user
to determine the icon's corresponding location at a glance.

.. container:: flex

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/mono-places-do.png
         :scale: 80%
         :figclass: do

         :noblefir:`Do.` |br|
         Use a bold, descriptive, and metaphorically recognizable
         icon to identify a user's landmark and guide the user to their
         desired destination—international icons are
         used instead of regional icons to better serve the diverse array
         of users that use KDE software.

   .. container::

      .. figure:: /img/mono-places-dont.png
         :scale: 80%
         :figclass: dont

         :iconred:`Don't.` |br|
         Don't use places icons based off of real locations or
         brands unless the landmark filesystem location
         is directly tied to that location or brand—more generic icons
         are meaningful for more users in more usecases.
