Purpose
-------

Aesthetics are nearly as important to users as functionality.
If your app looks bad, users will not want to use it and they will prefer to use other apps.
Users spend a large amount of time working with computers, which is why ensuring your app remains pleasant to look at for a long duration of time is important.

Guidelines
----------

Aesthetics are highly subjective, but some things are fairly set in stone:

* Keep your app's graphics simple and distraction-free
* Don't clutter the screen with too many windows, dialogs, buttons, or other UI controls
* Limit the number of visual elements in your app
* Make sure your app's aesthetics match other applications: don't redefine standard visual elements in your application
* Don't use non-standard icons in your apps: what appears to be a self-evident icon to you will most likely be confusing and a visual distraction to users
* Give users some control over the look of your application: for most, this means simply respecting the system theme, but others may need extras
