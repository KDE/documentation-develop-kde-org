title: Consistency

description: Consistency within an app and consistency with other apps helps users get acclimated to new applications faster
---

Purpose
-------

Consistent apps implement familiar patterns using standard controls, icons, typography, and terminology.
Users will expect your app's features and behaviour to be like other apps, and meeting their expectations helps them get acclimated to your app.
Failing to meet these expectations will make it harder for new users to use your app, and will dilute the experience of other apps on the system as well.

Guidelines
----------

Use standard controls, icons, typography, and language.
These are the primitives of a user interface, and building a consistent application is hard without them.

Do not redefine patterns and control that already exist: this is a common trap for unexperienced designers.
Unexperienced designers often try to make unrelated components and patterns the same in the name of consistency, but this ends up hurting consistency as it redefines patterns and controls that already exist.

Effectively consistent applications apply consistency in a variety of ways, such as visual design and interaction.
Consistency benefits users and developers alike: users spend time using many apps, and do not want to learn an excessive amount of different things to do so.
Developers do not want to spend time implementing controls that already exist and implement common patterns in a consistent manner.

The following is a checklist of questions you can ask yourself when evaluating consistency:

* Does your app use standard patterns and controls?
  If your application reimplements patterns in its own ways or uses unfamiliar patterns, users will have a harder time getting acclimated to your app.

* Is your app internally consistent?
  An app cannot be consistent with other applications if it is not consistent with itself.

* Is your app consistent with earlier versions of itself?
  Users do not want to relearn an app they already know how to use.

* Is your app consistent with your target userbase's expectations?
  It's likely that your userbase has a set of preconceptions about what an app like yours should and shouldn't do: playing into these expectations is better than working against them.

* Is your app consistent with other applications?
