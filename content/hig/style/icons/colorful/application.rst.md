Application Icons
=================

![](/img/icon-applications.png)

Purpose
-------

Application icons are the expression of an application\'s brand. They
communicate the application\'s identity in a clear, bold, and friendly
manner. While application icons should be distinct from one another, all
icons should be unified with the same design style.

Design
------

Application icons always use the [colorful icon style](colorful.html).
Their baseline size is 48 pixels.

### 1st-Party App Icons

When creating a Breeze icon as your application\'s icon, there are some
things you should consider.

#### Recognizability

Your application\'s icon should be distinct and recognisable.

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Use a distinct silhouette and
set of colors. You can sample motifs from other icons where appropriate
to help with recognizability.](/img/distinct-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t solely base your
application\'s icon off of another icon. This can confuse users, and
tarnish both the reputation of your app and the app whose icon you
use.](/img/distinct-dont.png){.dont}
:::
:::

#### Metaphor

Your app\'s icon should use an appropriate metaphor to inform the user
what your app does.

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Use an appropriate metaphor
for your icon; this will inform users as to what your app
does.](/img/metaphor-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t use inappropriate
metaphors for your icon; this will confuse users as to what your app
does.](/img/metaphor-dont.png){.dont}

### 3rd-Party App Icons

When creating a Breeze theme version of an existing app\'s icon, it
critically important that the icon\'s existing brand and visual style be
preserved. The goal is to create a Breeze version of the icon, not
something completely new and different.

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Retain the silhouette of an
app\'s icon to preserve its core branding and recognizability for
users.](/img/gimp-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t dramatically change
the shape of an app\'s icon; this will make the application hard to
recognize.](/img/gimp-dont-silhouette.png){.dont}
:::
:::

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Retain the general branding
colors of an app\'s icon to preserve branding
recognizability.](/img/telegram-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t use a radically
different color palette from an app\'s icon; this will make it hard to
recognize, especially at small sizes.](/img/telegram-dont.png){.dont}
