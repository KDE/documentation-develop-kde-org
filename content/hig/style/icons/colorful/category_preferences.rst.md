Purpose
-------

Category and preferences icons guide the user through an application.
They appear in an application\'s navigation and configuration, guiding
the user with icons to what they want to get to. While category and
preferences icons should be distinct, all icons should be unified with
the same design style.

Design
------

Category and preferences icons always use the [colorful icon
style](colorful.html). Their only size is 32 pixels.

When creating category and preferences icons, consider the following
aspects of an icon:

### Metaphor

You should consider the metaphors being conveyed by your icon\'s design
choices.

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Use symbols that evoke the
metaphor of your icon\'s category.](/img/category-metaphor-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t use icons just for
the sake of having different visuals per categry---use meaningful
metaphors that inform the user about their
category.](/img/category-metaphor-dont.png){.dont}
:::
:::

### Recognisability

Category and preferences icons should be recognisable, yet connected.

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Do.`{.interpreted-text role="noblefir"} Keep icons unique, yet
connected. This allows users to easily identify icons as unique members
in a set.](/img/category-unique-do.png){.do}
:::

::: {.container}
![`Don't.`{.interpreted-text role="iconred"} Don\'t make icons too
similar to eachother--- this impairs the ability of users to distinguish
them.](/img/category-unique-dont.png){.dont}
:::
:::

::: {.container .flex}
::: {.container}
![`Caution.`{.interpreted-text role="ambientamber"} Be careful when
making icons extremely unique from eachother---they may not appear in
contexts that inform users that they\'re
related.](/img/category-unique-caution.png){.caution}
