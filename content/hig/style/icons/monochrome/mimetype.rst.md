MIME Type Icons
===============

MIME type icons are used to depict documents and files. They come in
four sizes: 16px, 22px, 32px, and 64px. MIME type icons use the
[monochrome style](../monochrome/index.html) for 16px and 22px sizes,
and the [colorful style](index.html) for 32px and 64px sizes.

Unlike most monochromatic icons, MIME type icons use the primary color
of their colourful counterpart.

Purpose
-------

MIME type icons allow a user to quickly recognize the types of their
files without needing to look at a file\'s extension or contents. They
primarily appear in file listings in large amounts, and their design
reflects a sense of unity among files in a user\'s system.

### Iconography

MIME type icons use bold and recognizable symbols that allow a user to
determine the filetype at a glance.

filetype.](/img/mono-mime-dont.png){.dont}

MIME types associated with a brand identity use elements of their brand
to make it easier for users to connect the icon to its filetype.
