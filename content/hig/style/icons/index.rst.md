Purpose
-------

Icons are pictorial representations of functions and objects. They
convey meaning that users perceive almost instantaneously and are an
important part of a program\'s visual identity.

Well-designed icons strongly impact users\' overall impression of the
design. Consistent use of icons also improves usability by making
programs, objects, and actions easier to identify and learn.

General Guidelines
------------------

-   Use icons from the system icon theme whenever possible. Avoid using
    custom icons. New icons should be added to an icon theme.
-   Design icons with a small number of metaphors that are
    understandable independent of language and culture. Apply metaphors
    only once (e.g. don\'t use a brush twice for different actions).
-   Simplify, but don\'t go overboard.
-   Avoid using text in icon designs; it cannot be localized and tends
    to look bad at small sizes.
-   Many icons come in multiple sizes. Each version should be visually
    optimized and pixel-perfect for its particular size. Larger sizes
    offer more opportunity for detail and visual pizazz, while smaller
    version should be stripped of everything not absolutely necessary.
