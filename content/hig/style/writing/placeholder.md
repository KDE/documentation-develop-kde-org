title: Placeholder

Purpose
-------

A placeholder can be shown on an input element that expects text input.
It can either contain an example of the expected format, or a hint about
the action that will be triggered when the user types in the input
element.

Guidelines
----------

### Example

-   A placeholder with an example is not a replacement for a label, but
    should give the user only an additional hint about what kind of data
    is expected.

### Actions

-   A placeholder with an action replaces the label.
-   Use an ellipsis (...) after the text.
-   Show visiual feedback as soon as the user types, e.g. trigger the
    action or show a menu with autocompletion suggestions.
-   Keep the text as short as possible.
-   Since the placeholder will not be visible anymore as soon as the
    user types, you should only use it on standalone input elements, not
    in groups of input elements such as forms.
-   Use [sentence style capitalization](/hig/style/writing/capitalization).
