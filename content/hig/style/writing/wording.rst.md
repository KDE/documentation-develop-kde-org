Wording
=======

Purpose
-------

Every word displayed in an application is part of a conversation with
users. This conversation is an opportunity to provide clarity and to
help people feel comfortable in the system.

Guidelines
----------

-   Use terminology that is familiar and easy to understand for the
    target audience (i.e. Persona) of your application.
-   Start your sentence with the most important objective first.
-   Use short words, active verbs and common nouns.
-   Avoid `contraction`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} such as
    \"Don\'t\", \"Won\'t\", etc.
-   Avoid abbreviations (including ampersand instead of \'and\'),
    acronyms, and tech-babble.
-   Use an informal and friendly tone, but not too informal or humorous.
-   Avoid popular, but transient, words and phrases.
-   Keep information short and consistent; avoid redundancy or
    wordiness. e.g. Don\'t repeat the dialog title in the dialog text.
-   Don\'t abuse `capitalization`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} because
    it draws people's attention.
-   For date and time information, consider that your app may
    potentially be used for several years; don\'t use immutable date
    references like *this year* unless it is algorithmically determined.
-   Follow system-wide wording conventions for basic functions to keep
    wording consistent.
-   In general, exclamation points should be used sparingly in
    user-interface strings. In particular, they should not be used for
    error messages, to avoid an effect upon the user similar to WRITING
    IN ALL-CAPS.
