Contractions
============

Short version
-------------

Instead of:

don\'t, won\'t, it\'s, can\'t, there\'s, \...

\...use:

do not, will not, it is, cannot, there is, \...

Longer version
--------------

In general, contractions (such as the examples above) should not be used
when writing user-interface strings, for two main reasons:

-   contractions are avoided in formal writing
-   they make English text harder to understand for non-native readers
    (and although [KDE has great translation
    teams](http://l10n.kde.org/), the original English string is used if
    no translation exists)

For further discussion on this issue, in general, see the following blog
