This page documents the steps to release software packages developed by the KDE community.

This guide applies to all software which is **not** part of a bigger bundle like [Frameworks, Plasma and KDE Gear](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/releaseme/-/blob/master/plasma/README.md), which have specific release cycles and release managers.
