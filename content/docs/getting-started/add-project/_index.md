We encourage projects to become part of KDE and to use our infrastructure for your Qt and KDE software.

There are many reasons to turn your project into part of KDE:

* A Continuous Integration and Delivery system that makes it easy to build, test and publish your project to many platforms
* An integrated translation infrastructure
* Your project will gain more visibility under the KDE umbrella
* Tarballs will be available on a mirrorlist under KDE CDN
* Your software can be maintained even after you no longer want to work on your project


To add a new application or library to the KDE ecosystem,
follow the Incubator and/or KDE Review processes as described
below.

You will need a [KDE Identity](https://identity.kde.org/index.php?r=registration/index) to use [KDE Invent](https://invent.kde.org).
