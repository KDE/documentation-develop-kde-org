We encourage projects to become part of KDE and to use our infrastructure for their Qt and KDE software.

There are many reasons to turn your project into part of KDE:

* A [Continuous Integration and Delivery system](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/Continuous_Integration_System) that makes it easy to build, test and publish your project to many platforms
* An [integrated translation infrastructure](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/ki18n/-/blob/master/docs/programmers-guide.md) 
* Your project will gain more visibility under the KDE umbrella
* Tarballs will be available on a mirrorlist under KDE CDN
* Your software can be maintained even after you no longer want to work on your project

To add a new application or library to the KDE ecosystem, follow the Incubation and/or KDE Review processes as described below.

You will need a [KDE Identity](https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab#Logging_in) to use [KDE Invent](https://invent.kde.org).
