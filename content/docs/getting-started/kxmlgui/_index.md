This tutorial will guide you in creating a small text editor using
[KTextEditor](docs:ktexteditor;ktexteditor-index.html)
, [KXmlGui](docs:kxmlgui;kxmlgui-index.html) for
the window and [KIO](https://api-staging.kde.org/kio-index.html)
for saving and loading files.

<!-- TODO: investigate why KIO can't be linked with docs: -->

KXmlGui is built on top of QtWidgets and provides several libraries easily create your user interfaces with C++. QtWidgets is a mature technology with several premade components to easily create user interfaces, and it is strongly geared towards non-convergent, traditional desktop interfaces.

The knowledge gained from this tutorial will introduce you to several KDE libraries that are managed with C++, and should prove useful for other tutorials, like [Kirigami]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/kirigami" >}}).
