Rust has become a popular programming language with many desirable features like a batteries-included toolchain and a growing development ecosystem, and there is [demand](https://areweguiyet.com/) for the desktop applications field.

QML offers an intuitive way to create user interfaces while [Kirigami](/docs/getting-started/kirigami) extends QML to provide useful UI components and it implements UI/UX patterns for mobile and desktop.

You will learn how to combine Rust and QML with the help of [cxx-qt](https://kdab.github.io/cxx-qt/book/getting-started/index.html), a project that lets you use C++ libraries like Qt using idiomatic Rust.

This will allow you to write desktop applications that are cross platform, platform native, and that take advantage of an already existing, well established desktop applications toolkit.
