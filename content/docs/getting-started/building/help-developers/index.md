The KDE developers are here to assist you if you need any help with KDE software development.

There are several ways to get in touch with KDE developers, either generally or for a specific project. The most important communication channels are:
* **Real-time chat:** [#kde-devel](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/#kde-devel:kde.org) room on [Matrix](https://community.kde.org/Matrix)
* **Forum:** [Development forum](https://discuss.kde.org/c/development/10) on [KDE Discuss](https://discuss.kde.org)
* **Mailing list:** : [kde-devel](https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel ) ([Learn more about mailing lists](http://kde.org/support/#mailinglists))

These are general KDE development communication channels, and you may be directed to a more appropriate place for the project you're interested in.

* Many projects and teams have their own real-time chat channels, which can be found on the [Matrix Rooms](https://community.kde.org/Matrix#Rooms) page.
* There is a [list of mailing lists](http://www.kde.org/mailinglists/) if you want to find a mailing list for a specific team directly.

The [Get Involved](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved) wiki page includes links to more general contribution teams.
