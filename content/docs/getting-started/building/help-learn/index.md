Most KDE software is written in C++ using the [Qt toolkit](https://www.qt.io) and [KDE Frameworks](https://develop.kde.org/products/frameworks/). Though prior experience with these technologies or other programming languages is helpful, you don't need to be a C++ programmer to get started! For example, no programming knowledge whatsoever is required to do things like improving text labels.

If you'd like to dive deeper into it:

* The Qt wiki contains [a list of online books](https://wiki.qt.io/Books) for learning Qt programming.
* Qt also provides [lots of examples](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtexamplesandtutorials.html ) you can look at.
* For visual learners, [this YouTube playlist of QML tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxyTkXLbcV4&list=PL6CJYn40gN6hdNC1IGQZfVI707dh9DPRc) by KDE patron [KDAB](https://www.kdab.com) may be useful.
* The reference API documentation for KDE Frameworks can be found on the [KDE API website](https://api.kde.org/).
* KDE also provides a [curated wiki page full of learning resources](https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development/Learn).
