## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you in publishing a new application on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps).

We assume that the application you want to publish on Google Play is already packaged and published in one of [KDE's F-Droid repositories]({{< ref "android#getting-applications" >}}). If not then read the tutorial on [packaging and publishing applications for Android]({{< ref "packaging_applications" >}}).

If, in the past, your application was published on Google Play by uploading APKs then read the tutorial on [publishing new releases of old applications on Google Play]({{< ref "releasing-old-apps" >}}).
