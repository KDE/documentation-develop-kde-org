## Folder Structure

{{< sections >}}
{{< section-left >}}

To start a new widget from scratch, first create a folder for your new widget somewhere in your coding directory (eg: `~/Code/plasmoid-helloworld`).

Inside it create another folder called `package`. Everything inside the `package` folder will be what we eventually install to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/com.example.helloworld/`. Eventually we will zip the contents of `package` and share them online. We can keep text editor files, build scripts, screenshots, etc outside the `package` directory.

Inside the package folder will be a `metadata.json`. This file will describe the name of the widget, the category it's in, and various other plasma specific keys like the main QML file.

Inside `contents`, we will create the `ui` and `config` folders. `ui` is the folder which should contain your layout files like the `main.qml` and the `configGeneral.qml`. `configGeneral.qml` is the layout of the first tab in the widget's configuration window.

Inside the `config` folder we have the `main.xml` which contains the schema of all our serialized configuration keys+values. The `config.qml` is used to define the tabs in the configuration window. Each tab will open a QML layout file (like `ui/configGeneral.qml`).

Note that you don't *need* the 3 config files. You can get away with just the `main.qml` and `metadata.json` for a barebones widget.

## metadata.json

{{< sections >}}
{{< section-left >}}

Inside the `metadata.json` file we need to set the `Name` of the widget.

`Icon` is the icon name associated with the widget. You can search for icon names in the `/usr/share/icons` folder. You can also look for an icon name by right-clicking your app launcher widget then editing the icon in its settings. It uses a searchable interface and lists them by category. Plasma's SDK also has the Cuttlefish app ([screenshot](https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/cuttlefish/cuttlefish.png)) which you can install with `sudo apt install plasma-sdk`.

`Id` needs to be a unique name, since it's used for the folder name it's installed into. If you are planning to contribute the widget to KDE, you can use `org.kde.helloworld` for example, otherwise you can use any id like `com.example.helloworld` or `com.github.zren.helloworld`.

Widgets installed by the user (without root) like when you "Install New Widgets" will be installed to `~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/` (which may not yet exist). The default widgets shipped with KDE are installed to `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/`.

`Category` is the category the widget can be filtered with in the widget list. A list of category names can be found [here]({{< ref "properties.md#category" >}}).

`KPackageStructure` is also needed to just define that this package is a plasma widget, and where its entry point is.

`"X-Plasma-API-Minimum-Version" : "6.0"` is required to enable Plasma 6 support. Plasmoids without this key are assumed to only work with Plasma 5 and will not be mad available in the UI.

For Plasma 6 changes, read the [Porting Plasmoids to KF6]({{< ref "porting_kf6.md" >}}) guide.

For the other properties, read the [`metadata.json` section in the Widget Properties page]({{< ref "properties.md#metadatajson" >}}).

This is the entry point. Various properties are available to be set. You should know that widgets have several ways of being represented. 

* You can have a widget in the panel, which is just an icon that will show a popup window when clicked.
* You can also have it on the desktop as a desktop widget which can be resized by the user. As a desktop widget it can switch between the "icon view" when smaller (which opens a popup), and directly showing the contents of the popup on the desktop when there's enough room.
* You can also have the widget inside another widget (a containment) like the system tray or the panel itself.
* The widget can also be run like an application in its own window (Calculator).

The root of the applet is required to be a `PlasmoidItem` in Plasma 6.

`plasmoid.location` and `plasmoid.formFactor` can tell you how the widget is placed. `plasmoid` is a global variable which is defined when you `import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid`.

`Plasmoid.compactRepresentation` (note the capitalization) and `Plasmoid.fullRepresentation` are used to define the layout of the small "icon" view and the full "popup" view. These are both properties of the main `PlasmoidItem`. If neither are set, by default the main `PlasmoidItem` is the full representation. This behavior can be modified using the `preferredRepresentation` property of the root `PlasmoidItem`

If you change the compact representation, you will need to use a `MouseArea` [QML Item](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-mousearea.html) to toggle the `plasmoid.expanded` property. See the `DefaultCompactRepresentation.qml` [example here](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-desktop/blob/master/desktoppackage/contents/applet/DefaultCompactRepresentation.qml).

`Layout.preferredWidth` can be used to define the default width of a panel widget, or the size of the popup window (unless it is in the system tray). The system tray has a fixed hardcoded size for its popups. `Layout.preferredWidth` can also define the width of the compact "icon" view in the horizontal panel, not just the full "popup" width. Note that the `Layout.preferredWidth`/`Layout.preferredHeight` of the `Plasmoid.compactRepresentation` will automatically scale to the thickness of the panel depending on if it's a vertical or horizontal panel.

`Layout.minimumWidth` can be used to define the minimum size for a desktop widget / popup.

`width`/`height` (not `Layout.__`) can be used to define the default size of a desktop widget. Desktop widgets currently ignore `Layout.preferredWidth` when calculating the default size.

You can set the tooltip contents and various other things in the `main.qml`.

### Examples of `main.qml`

<div class="filepath">contents/ui/main.qml</div>

```qml
import QtQuick
import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid
import org.kde.plasma.components as PlasmaComponents

PlasmoidItem{
    PlasmaComponents.Label {
        text: "Hello World!"
    }
}

```

To show the text in the panel rather than in a popup:

<div class="filepath">contents/ui/main.qml</div>

```qml
import QtQuick
import org.kde.plasma.components as PlasmaComponents
import org.kde.plasma.plasmoid

PlasmoidItem{
    // Always display the full view. Never show the compact icon view
    // like it does by default when shown in the panel.
    Plasmoid.preferredRepresentation: Plasmoid.fullRepresentation

    PlasmaComponents.Label {
        text: "Hello World!"
    }
}
```

---

To set the popup size:

<div class="filepath">contents/ui/main.qml</div>

```qml

```

{{< alert title="Note" color="info" >}}
Plasmoids previously used a `metadata.desktop` file. This is discouraged, because the conversion to JSON will need to be done at runtime.
Shipping a JSON file directly is supported for all of Plasma 5/6.

In case you still have a desktop file inside of your project you can convert it to JSON and afterwards remove it.

```bash
desktoptojson -s plasma-applet.desktop -i metadata.desktop
rm metadata.desktop
```

If you automatically converted the `metadata.json` from a `metadata.desktop`, the `KPlugin` section may still contain the `ServiceTypes` key. This needs to be replaced by a `KPackageStructure` entry in the json's top level.

See the [Porting an existing plasmoid]({{< ref "porting_kf6.md#porting-an-existing-plasmoid" >}}) section of the KF6 porting guide for fixes in the `metadata.json` generated from the desktop file.
