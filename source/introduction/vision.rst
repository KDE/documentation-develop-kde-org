   ''Simple by default, powerful when needed.''


Design is driven at the highest level by a vision. We rely on a set of design principles to fulfill that design vision. These principles guide all aspects of the user interface design.

Design Vision
-------------
The design vision focuses on two attributes of KDE software that connect its past to its future.

-  ''Simple by default'' - Simple and inviting. KDE software is pleasant 
   to experience and easy to use.
-  ''Powerful when needed'' - Power and flexibility. KDE software allows 
   users to be effortlessly creative and efficiently productive.

Design Principles
-----------------
The following design principles are used in support of the Design Vision.

-  Simple by default

   -  *Make it easy to focus on what matters.* - Remove or minimize
      elements not crucial to the primary or main task. Use spacing to
      keep things organized. Use color to draw attention. Reveal
      additional information or optional functions when needed, later in
      the presentation.
   -  *I know how to do that!* - Make things easier to learn by reusing
      design patterns from other applications. Other applications that
      use good design are a precedent to follow.
   -  *Do the heavy lifting for me.* - Make complex tasks simple. Make
      novices feel like experts. Create ways in which your users can
      naturally feel empowered by your software.

-  Powerful when needed

   -  *Solve a problem.* - Identify and make very clear to the user what
      need is addressed and how.
   -  *Always in control.* - It should always be clear what can be done,
      what is happening and what happened. The user should never feel at
      the mercy of the tool. Give the user the final say.
   -  *Be flexible.* - Provide sensible defaults but consider optional
      functionality or customizations that do not interfere with the
      primary task.
