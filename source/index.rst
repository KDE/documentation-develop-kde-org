The KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer application designers and developers
a set of recommendations for designing and developing user interfaces for mobile,
desktop, convergent applications and workspace widgets. Their aim is to improve the 
experience for users by making application and widget interfaces more consistent
and hence more intuitive and learnable.

   ''Simple by default, powerful when needed.''

KDE encourages developing and designing for customization, while providing good 
default settings. Integrating into other desktop environments is also a virtue, 
but ultimately we aim for perfection within our own Plasma desktop environment 
with the default themes and settings. This aim should not be compromised.
