The KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer application designers and developers
a set of recommendations for designing and developing user interfaces for mobile, 
desktop, convergent applictions and workspace widgets. Their aim is to improve the 
experience for users by making application and widget interfaces more consistent 
and hence more intuitive and learnable.
