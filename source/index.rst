The Classic KDE Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) offer application designers and developers a set of recommendations for designing and developing user interfaces for QWidget-based, desktop-only applictions. Their aim is to improve the experience for users by making application interfaces more consistent and hence more intuitive and learnable.
