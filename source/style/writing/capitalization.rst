Capitalization
==============

Purpose
-------

*Capitalization* is a feature of case-sensitive languages to foster
relevance by drawing attention to words with capital letters. For a consistent
look and feel of the software, it is important to implement capitalization
consistently.

Guidelines
----------

There are two types of capitalization, title capitalization and sentence
style capitalization:

Title Capitalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Title capitalization is when every word in a sentence, statement,
phrase, or label is capitalized except for certain words. Use title
capitalization primarily for titles and headers, but also for command labels.
For example:

-  Titles and headers on windows, dialog boxes, tabs, lists, group boxes, tree
   views, etc.
-  Menu titles and menu item labels
-  Button labels

Do not capitalize:

-  Articles: a, an, the
-  Coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, for, nor, etc.
-  Prepositions (fewer than five letters): on, at, to, from, by, etc.

Capitalize everything else.


Sentence Style Capitalization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sentence style capitalization is when the first letter of the sentence,
statement, phrase, or label is capitalized and all other words are lower
case. The only exception to this is proper nouns which are always
capitalized.

Use sentence style capitalization for text that is or could be read as a
sentence, or that is part of a sentence in conjunction with other elements.
For example:

-  Tooltip text
-  Placeholder text in text fields
-  Checkbox labels
-  Labels to the left of controls in a Form Layout
-  Descriptions of anything

Acronyms/Initialisms, Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Words such as URL, JPEG, or LDAP should be written in capital letters
-  Internet (if referring to *the* Internet) takes a capital I.
