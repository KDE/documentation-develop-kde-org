Elevation and Shadows
=====================

Shadows should be horizontally-centered, but vertically offset, to
provide the illusion that a light source is over the top of the screen.
The default shadow color should be Shade Black (see :doc:`Breeze Colors <color>`)
with 35% opacity. The default size for window shadows is 64px. Menu &
tooltip shadows are 16px:

Shadows inside apps should use a size of 16px or below, so as not to
compete with the window shadows.
