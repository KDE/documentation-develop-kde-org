Group box
=========

Purpose
-------

A *group box* is a labeled rectangular area that surrounds a set of
related controls. A *frame* (also known as a panel) is an unlabeled
rectangular area that can be used to mark relationship.

Group box and frame are a way to show visual relationships; it provides
no additional functionality.

Guidelines
----------

Is this the right control?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Always use a group box to arrange related controls.
-  Use a frame to arrange related controls that cannot be labeled.
-  Do not group single controls.
-  Show relationship by layout only.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

-  Do not nest grouping elements; use layout to show relationships
   within a group.
-  Do not place controls in group box caption.
-  Do not disable groups. To indicate that a group of controls doesn't
   currently apply, disable all the controls within the group, but not
   the group itself.
-  Put a :doc:`splitter` between aligned grouping controls.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Label the group box with a descriptive caption.
-  Do not assign an access key to the group box caption.
-  Set the group box or frame shadow to 'flat' to provide the consistent
   spacing required to convey relationship.
