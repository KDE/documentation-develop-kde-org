Slider
======

Purpose
-------

A *slider* is a widget with which a user may set a value by moving an
indicator, usually in a horizontal fashion. The user may also click on a
point on the slider to change the setting. It is different from a
scrollbar in that it is typically used to adjust a value without
changing the format of the display or the other information on the
screen. A slider is used to set defined, contiguous values or a range of
discrete values. It is a good choice when values have a relative
quantity, not a numeric value. Usually, changes made on the slider are
shown immediately. That instant feedback supports input that is not
necessarily precise. Compared with spin controls a slider provides
faster changes within a larger range but with lower accuracy. Sliders
are almost solely operable by mouse.

Guidelines
----------

Is this the right control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Use a slider when adjusting the value relative to its current value
   is more important than choosing an absolute value.
-  Use a slider when it is useful for the user to control the rate of
   change of the value in real time.
-  If the value is open-ended on one or both ends, consider using a
   :doc:`Spin Box <spinbox>` instead.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

-  Try to give immediate feedback while the user makes a selection.
-  Size the control so that a user can easily set the desired value.
-  Do not use a non-linear scale, e.g. logarithmic.

Appearance
~~~~~~~~~~

-  Label the slider with a text label to its left, using sentence
   capitalization. Provide an access key in the label that allows the
   user to give focus directly to the slider.
-  Align the label horizontally in line with the slider.
-  You can show the current value on the right of the slider or if space
   is very dense show it only as a tooltip when the slider is moved

-  Add the unit to the current value caption, if appropriate.

Slider with few steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

eg screen size, symbol-size

   :alt: Spacing

   Spacing of slider components

-  Mark significant values along the length of the slider with text or
   checkmarks. Checkmark have a height of 4 px or 8 if you want to
   emphasize them.
-  Min/max labels are optional. Label min/max with real values, eg
   '640x480' and '5120Ã—2880' in case of screen resolution.
-  Label the range of values; use checkmark and value label; don't label
   every checkmark.

Slider with many steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

eg volume control, mouse speed, brightness

   Exact value is not important

-  Don't show checkmarks if the exact value is not important
-  Don't show min/max label if the values don't give the user additional
   information, eg. don't label them 0%, 100%
-  If the exact value might be important to the user offer an input
   field instead of the current value label

Slider and Spinbox together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  Use both a slider and spin box when the value is constrained at both
   ends, and when there is a large range of values (more than 20 steps)
   but precise control over the value is needed nevertheless.
-  Consider using only a slider *or* a spin box if a well-defined workflow
   makes the other redundant.
-  The values of the slider and spin box should be linked so changes to
   one are immediately reflect in another.
-  The spin box should be aligned with the long axis of the slider: if
   the slider is horizontal, the spin box should be to the right of the
   slider and aligned vertically with the center of the slider; if
   the slider is vertical, the spin box should be below the slider and
   aligned horizontally with the center of the slider.
-  Provide a single label using a text label above it or to the left of
   the widgets, using sentence capitalization. Provide an access key in
   the label that should give focus directly to the spin box.
-  Mark significant values along the length of the slider with text or
   tick marks.
