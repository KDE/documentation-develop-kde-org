- **Human Interface Guidelines**, **HIG**

    A set of recommendations for designing and developing user interfaces for 
    mobile, desktop, convergent applications and workspace widgets.

- **User Interface**, **UI** 

    In the field of human–computer interaction, the User Interface is the space 
    where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this 
    interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine 
    from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back 
    information that aids the operators' decision-making process.

- **User Experience**, **UX**

    UX refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular 
    product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, 
    affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction 
    and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of 
    system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience 
    may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about 
    individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User 
    experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to 
    changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as 
    the wider usage context in which they can be found. In the end, user 
    experience is about how the user interacts with and experiences the 
    product.
