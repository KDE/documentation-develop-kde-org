One-handed use
==============

According to `research`_, about half of users use their phone with just
one hand in a given situation. This limits the areas they can
comfortably reach with their thumb. The safest way to hold a phone in
one hand is resting the bottom end in the palm. Another 15% hold them in
the palms of both hands. Both ways to hold a phone make the top of the
screen hard to reach.

Kirigami's phone components are therefore optimized to favor the center
or bottom of the screen for primary interactive elements, while putting
secondary elements into drawers which can be opened from up to three
different points of the screen and then again favor the lower parts of
the screen. It also has an "overscroll" feature, which allows you pull
down the top part of the screen in case you have to reach e.g. the
topmost items of a list.

When using Kirigami, make sure that often-used controls are never placed
at the top of the screen, and also avoid the screen corners in general.
