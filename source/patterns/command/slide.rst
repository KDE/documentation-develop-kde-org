This is an alternative to always visible controls in lists: If the user
often performs tasks on single items of a list, add a handle on the side
the list item (next to the context drawer's edge, defined by a
system-wide configuration) which, when slid sideways, reveals actions
for that particular item. As soon as the user taps anywhere else, the
handle is slid back.
