Drawers
=======

Drawers do not take away any room from the content, but need an extra
action to access, and should therefore not be used for controls that are
part of an application's main tasks.

Global drawer
-------------

The global drawer is used for global, context-independent controls.

-  The drawer is opened by an edge-swipe (the side is system-defined)
   and closed by swiping in the other direction or tapping outside of
   the panel
-  For the guidelines regarding its content, see 
   :doc:`global drawer </components/globaldrawer>`.

Context drawer
--------------

The context drawer (the side is system-defined) is used for
context-specific controls that affect only the currently selected object
(e.g. copy, delete etc.).

-  The drawer is opened by an edge-swipe and closed by swiping in 
   the other direction or tapping outside of the panel
-  For the guidelines regarding its content, see the 
   :doc:`context drawer </components/contextdrawer>`.

Bottom drawer and dialog sheet
