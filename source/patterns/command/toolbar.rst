-  Use Toolbar + Menu Button command pattern when the number of
   frequently used commands are about 8 or less, and the remaining
   commands are not essential to performing the primary task of the
   application. The toolbar pattern exposes the frequently used
   commands. The menu button pattern exposes more of the command
   structure.
-  Commands are also exposed using context menus, a context panel or by
   the direct manipulation of content.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Web browser, File manager, Text editor, Email, Calendar, Image editor,
Music player, Archiver

-  If there are controls that need to be accessed often within the
   application's primary tasks but the content needs as much space to be
   available as possible, put the main controls in a toolbar.
-  The toolbar is at the bottom of the user interface and should not
   contain more than four buttons.
-  If there are more then four actions, put the remaining ones in the
   global drawer or context drawer
