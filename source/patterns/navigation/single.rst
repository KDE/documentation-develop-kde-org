-  These patterns are useful when each piece of content is meant to be
   shown one at a time.
-  Controls are usually provided to allow the user to move from one
   piece of content to the next.
-  For media (dis)play, whether playback controls are shown depends on
   the type of media:

   -  For audio, always show playback controls
   -  For video, show playback controls only on tap (pausing the video)

-  |touchicon| For image galleries as well as playlists, use left/right swipe to
   switch between files to (dis)play
-  Examples include a slideshow, or a video or music playlist, or a
   single-page web browser.
-  Display properties of the currently shown object which are essential
   for the application's main task below the object, show additional
   properties on demand in the :doc:`context drawer </components/contentdrawer>`.
