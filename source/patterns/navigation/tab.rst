Pattern for a 2-deep structure.

-  There are two different ways tabs can be used:

   -  One is for splitting a user interface that does not fit on a
      single screen into several groups
   -  The other is for viewing multiple documents (e.g. websites in a
      browser) in the same application instance

-  See the :doc:`tab </components/tab>` for details.
