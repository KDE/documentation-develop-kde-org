-  The Collapsible List pattern is a space-efficient way of showing
   2-deep content. This pattern is useful for plasmoids and applications
   where the layout must be compact. A :doc:`tree view <treeview>` can be used to
   implement this pattern.
-  The Crossbar pattern arranges categories vertically and the content
   within the selected category horizontally. This pattern is often used
   for navigating video libraries.
