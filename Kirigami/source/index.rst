Build apps that adapt beautifully to mobile, desktop, and everything in between.



Convergent
----------

The line between desktop and mobile is blurring, and users expect the same 
quality experience on every device. Applications using Kirigami adapt 
brilliantly to mobile, desktop, and everything in between.
See :doc:`convergence in the HIG <hig:convergence>` for more 
details.


Responsive
----------

Kirigami apps adapt to more than just the devices we use them on, always 
offering the optimal layout depending on how they are used by your audience.

See :doc:`responsive in the HIG <hig:introduction/responsive>` for more 
details.

Elegant
-------

Kirigami is smooth and animated, uses consistent components, and a clearly 
defined workflow. People using Kirigami will appreciate the smart workflow and 
no-gimmick design.
